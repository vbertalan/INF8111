    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to complexities of software systems, software bugs are prevalent. Companies, especially large ones, usually use a Bug Tracking System (BTS), also called Issue Tracking System, to manage and track records of bugs. Besides developers and testers, many projects, mainly open source projects, allow users to report new bugs in their BTS.\n",
    "To do that, users have to fill a form with multiple fields. An important subset of\n",
    "these fields provides categorical data and only accepts values that range from a fixed list of\n",
    "options (e.g., component, version and product of the system). Another two important fields\n",
    "are the summary and the description. The users are free to write anything in both fields\n",
    "and the only constraint is that the summary has a maximum number of characters. The\n",
    "submission of a form creates a page, called bug report or issue report, which contains all\n",
    "the information about a bug.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the lack of communication and syncronization, users may not be aware that a specific bug was already submitted and report it again. Identifying duplicate bug reports is important task in the BTSs and it is the subject of this TP. Basically, our goal is to develop a system that will compare a new bug report with the submitted ones and rank them based on textual similarity. This ranked list will be used by a triager to manually identify whether a report is duplciate or not."

      " My name is Dave Meyers. I help develop the Cyberprise product family at Wall Data. experiencing a problem when we attempt to use Communicator to display the HTML we generate from a variety of sources (Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, output from other Wall tools, In operating the Cyberprise I select from a list of documents (presented as at which point we generate HTML that consists of a pair of frames. The actual document content is displayed in a large upper frame, while a \"back\" button is displayed in a small lower frame. The user presses the back button to return to the list of documents. If the user presses the back button while a (large) document is being loaded into the upper frame, Communicator traps. To prevent this, we have added J frameset to \"disable\" the back button until the document has finished loading in the upper frame. This works fine, but there is a further mystery. If the document content in the upper frame. The evidence of this reprocessing is that the scroll bar thumb goes through the process of starting large and gradually shrinking to its final size (as if Communicator were actually reloading the document) and the progress meter goes back to and \"counts up\" to If the user presses our back button in the lower frame during this reprocessing, again Communicator traps. We are currently working around this problem by ensuring that we never set charset to but this is not a good solution for a couple of reasons: We know what other character sets might cause this reprocessing behavior in Communicator. We are changing the specification from to but have any equivalent operation for foreign character sets if they turn out to be similarly problematic.

      " Change have been suggested, discussed and agreed to for the PLEvent librayr component of NSPR. These changes are described in the following text version of the spec. NSPR Change Specification: Client Requirements for PLEvent Introduction Rick Potts, a wizardly engineer in C PLEvent library in support of the next release Netscape Client; specifically, the requirement titled \"Multiple Event Queues for An additional requirement came from the chanel. Specifically the requirement titled \"NGLayout Calls This requirement should be viewed as if it came from Netscape since the function requested will be part of the Netscape branded Client as well as the Mozilla client. This paper documents those changes. Requirements NGLayout Calls This requirement is obsolete following the change to this specification in which the function The NGLayout engine for Windows is being implemented as an A causes the engine to call desired behavior is to have the effect of the call occur only once; subsequent calls are to behave as a Remove function The function This design made things a bit difficult for other platforms; Mac was the least happy. Anyway, after some discussion with the Mac folks, Rick Potts and others, the client folks decided they wanna do away with platforms. Note that the client becomes responsible for maintaining state of which PLE Multiple Event Queues The PLEvent library has slightly different API and capabilities between Unix and Windows platforms. In the Unix implementation, the client can create multiple Event Queues by calling Windows implementation, the API is different: A single event queue is created on the call to multiple events queues for Windows. In addition the already identified API for event queue creation, PLEvent library exposes slightly different API for handling the event queues. Unix provides for a client uses in a raw function call. Oh well; so much for platform independence. Windows provides for a and a functions are used by the Windows applications in processing events in the main Windows message pump. The Client wants different behaviors for a Windows event queue. The first behavior is the same as for extant single event queue. The second behavior is to not have an associated event receiver window created with the event queue. Similarly, for Unix, an event queue is desired that does not have the Unix pipe, and its associated selectable FD. This concept creates a \"unified\" event queue; that is: a single API that will operate on an event queue in a fully platform independent maner. External Specification NGLayout Calls No public API changes are required. Remove function This is a rather straight forward thingie. Rip it out. Other functions go with it, implicitly: Multiple Event Queues Changed API Items No existing APIs will be changed in the NSPR release. The funciton platforms only; it is currently compiled for both Windows and Unix platforms. The function release of NSPR for both Windows and Unix platforms. Users of this function should use the same as the extant are no known callers of Windows. The function Windows. New API Items FUNCTION: DESCRIPTION: uses platform specific notify mechanisms. For Unix, the platform specific notify mechanism provides an FD that may be extracted using the function a function call. For Windows, the platform specific notify mechanism provides an event receiver window that is called by Windows to process the event using the windows message pump engine. INPUTS: name: A name, as a diagnostic aid. the thread that will \"handle\" events posted to this event queue. RETURNS: A pointer to a PLE char PRThread ); FUNCTION: DESCRIPTION: platform specific notify mechanism is created with the event queue. Users of this type of event queue must explicitly poll the event queue to retreive and process events. INPUTS: name: A name, as a diagnostic aid. the thread that will \"handle\" events posted to this event queue. RETURNS: A pointer to a PLE char PRThread ); FUNCTION: DESCRIPTION: handle of the event receiver window associated with the referenced PLE INPUTS: PLE RETURNS: event receiver window handle. RESTRICTIONS: PLE ); The PLE Internal Design NGLayout Calls A test for the first call to argument will create a lock that will be used for atomicly ensuring that the function of Remove function The platform specific content for Dependent sort of capability, similar to other NSPR things like this. All the \"md\" stuff will remain in unlike separate md files for other components in NSPR. The functions declarations will be removed from The function definitions will be removed from Multiple Event Queues The conditional compilation of PLE provide a Windows section, in addition to the Unix section extant today. The Windows section will contain a HWND pointer; this HWND will be handle for the event receiver window for this event queue. Windows it will call a static function that creates the event receiver window. For Unix it will create the pipes. The statically defined defined will be removed. A pointer to the first Windows event queue created will be statically anchored. Windows native event queue, then will deal with anchoring the PLE Unit Test Plan New Function Test A new test case will be developed. The new test, valid for both Unix and Windows platforms will exercise multiple event queues by passing a \"token\" via the event mechanism around a ring of threads. This test will be developed according the the general style of NSPR test cases. Its purpose is to verify that the function works as specified. This is not a stress test. Regression Test The existing Windows test case will be ported to Windows The port will be done according to the suggestions found in the MSDN Library for porting applications to This test exercizes the events processing. This test case was used to port the PLEvent to from its original The PLEvents lib is believed to run succcessfully on the client today. This test, ported to should ensure that it still works following these changes. Implementation Plan Yesterday. Oh! The Multiple Event Queues will be commited Removal of ready to use it. OK, Rick says ready. \n",

This did not occur in Sounds like an NSPR issue to me but since we currently have a Mac specific NSPR engineer just going to Cc: the NSPR folks rather than it. also dropping the priority to since it does NOT stop one from testing as long as a network connection exists before you launch Mozilla. This is approximately the same behavior I see running at home on a PC, so perhaps the problem is more global than just MAC. On NT if you try to make a connection before establishing the PPP circuit, all hope is lost. It might time out and go revisit the issue, but for periods exceeding my patience, all lookups fail immediately (and found exiting and restarting the communicator is the expediant solution. As far as looking for a MAC specific engineer, good of you to note that we specifically have one. But we still support NSPR on a MAC. The resources with which we do are our problem.

If I save the message with wrapped lines the saved text message is saved with those lines wrapped. This has actually caused me to have to a program that converts an emailed report to a format which I can easily import into Excel. The problem is annoying, however if I must choose between one or the other, I would choose to have long lines wrap. Additional customer input on line I remember a little better the problem I had with Netscape line wrapping. I would like it if long lines could wrap without actually inserting newline characters into the message itself. I would also like it if the long lines simply wrapped to the width of the window rather than the line length set in preferences. In other words, if I view a message with long lines and those lines are wrapped to make it easier to read, I would like to be able to stretch the window and the lines adjust accordingly. Also, I would like to be able to save or print the message without the extra newline characters. \n",

(side note -I am still waiting on kipp or rickg to send me NGLayout component descriptions and will change this component name on my table if done) . reasoning for this request: like to change the name of my component on bugzilla from Rendering to Compositor. rendering is misleading. hopefully this will help prevent every visual artifact that appears in nglayout from being assigned to me. of the time some other part of nglayout that is causing the problem. alrady got a massive pile of stuff in my bug list marked NEW that has nothing to do with me and someone from QA should follow up on to see who these bugs really belong to. thank QA will follow up on bugs once we get all of them moved. ok terry? \n",

When completes, you want the thread blocked on the to run as quickly as possible. In UNIX systems, this usually means having threads waiting on have a high priority, usually kernel level, but not be runnable until the completes. Just before the blocked thread runs again, the priority is set back to normal user level priority. How does this relate to NSPR threading on the Mac: like to have the completion routine A priority if it fails to schedule the blocked thread itself because of a lock on the queues. The itself can reset priority back to normal when it is run. Thread priority is an issue that we may wish to address further. The current level priority and round robin scheduling \n",

Ideally, the mechanism would buffer at least the amount of data requested by the previous read to that source. Under this model, the first request would block and yield control to another thread, but subsequent requests of the same or smaller size would return immediately. This is a file ring buffer that I have partially implemented. However, this needs a global manager so that file coherency can be maintained across multiple to the same open file.

We are never going to deliver windows, or mac, or on any macos other than flatten the delivery area to something that makes sense. build directories are different for each platform. Windows uses M consistant nameing scheme for the build directories so that anyone can tell which build is which. I propose that we drop the minutes field and deliver into a directory that has the month, then date, and then hour of the build, followed by a milestone identifier. so something like no notification when the builds were complete. QA started rummaging around trying to find the builds for this morning. this is wrong. we should be telling them which builds to grab. this could be done via an automated from each platform, or minimally, done by hand. we need to get this all straightened out by so QA waste time downloading the wrong builds or trying to find the right ones when we should be telling them exactly where to go. \n",

      " Just worry about the main page of the site. As far as I know everything using is totally correct. The only thing not sure about is whether is a standard part of the DOM. This is current as of the milestone release on Use how the site looks in as a reference. Things to watch for: Floated table on the right side of the screen not taking up of the browser window as specified. Style sheets not working correctly even though they used to. The weird thing is that I selected some menu option like 'select stylesheet' in apprunner, and it suddenly used the right stylesheet for my site. The problem might be that Mozilla yet handle externally linked stylesheets correctly. Background color of the paragraph way at the bottom of the page spills over into the table which is floating to its right. This is a pretty major error, but not sure how hard or easy it might be to fix. Mozilla yet send a referring URL, according to the validator at Check out the validate link at the bottom of the page. DHTML stuff I tried work. just a really simple piece of Javascript. Maybe not using standard DOM? If any of the problems are with my site and are not the fault of the browser, sorry for wasting your time. Please let me know so I can fix whatever standard. Thanks! Please me if you have any questions. Keith \n",

In Standard mode the image should NOT push the first two tables' widths to pixels and therefore, the bottom table should extend pixels beyond the first two tables. Actual results: Behavior in Nav Quirks and Standard modes are identical. All three tables extend to pixels in width. Not sure where to categorize this bug - assigned to Layout. \n",

So, I can still check in changes whenever I feel like it, and not worry that my thing is different than something out there wrapped in a tarball. \n",

That is, the inner span should have effect on the rendering of the underlines. One way of looking at this is through inline boxes. The above generates two inline boxes, one for the outer span and one for the inner span. The inner inline box overlaps the outer inline box (in fact, in this particular case it is contained within Hello Lovely World The underlining should (as I understand it) be applied the outer inline only.

I am trying to fix some of But I need some help. Now, this particular set of warnings have to do with: I am assuming this is part of the I mistaken. The warnings I get are: In function int, int, int, int, enum warning: comparison between signed and unsigned warning: comparison between signed and unsigned warning: comparison between signed and unsigned warning: comparison between signed and unsigned warning: comparison between signed and unsigned At top level: warning: I then went first of all to line where this is the bit of code in question: ignoring extra row return; } Obviously, with row being an int, and probably being unsigned, this results in conflict. The easiest way to fix this would probably be to do a on the variable but I have a question to ask about this first, just to make sure being thorough: Since the statement case, then why not make the variable \"row\" unsigned, so it will match the type of the \"height\" variable, and no type cast is even This might make the code even more clear and logical. The same solution could be applied to the other warnings as is, make ALL of these unsigned, so they will match The other thing that makes me think this is the best solution is that I cannot think of any good reason why these variables ever would be negative somebody correct me if wrong. As to the warning on line the simple solution here would be to simply delete that line altogether, unless somebody is anticipating future use of it. But even then, if that is the case, it should be commented out, with an explanation given as to why it is there. Since I am just a beginner, having just completed a couple of introductory programming courses, I would appreciate it if people could give me feedback on this report; I want to know if I am on the right track.

      " I find a component named Registry directly. So, entering the bug under XPCOM registry. The bug seems to be coming from underlying libreg routines. At present, Profile Manager is using mozregistry to store the information and uses Registry calls to maintain the profile information. I have noticed that the registry APIs are not case sensitive. A case to verify this will be Rename operation of Profile Manager. apprunner -P rename. Check both cases, rename it to a diffrent name, every thing works fine and you will see the new name in the select box of profile manager. Rename it with same name but with some upper case letters. You find the profile name anymore in the select box. The reason being Rename operation calls for copy and delete operations. As it is case insensitive, I guess it does not create a new entry in the registry copies on to the same profile node) and at the end when it deletes, it deletes the same profile. \n",

RESULT - What happened The buttons being used both in forms and throughout the UI are too large, and inconsistent with the platform UI guidelines. As a Mac user, I find these deviations to be aesthetically displeasing, and suggest they be corrected, unless absolutely necessary. In particular: a.

So I propose an enhancement that allows me to automatically reject a cookie with a lifetime longer than, say, three months.

At a minimum, the existence of this preference would force sites to consider their expiration policy and select something more reasonable, something that reflects the actual useful lifetime of the cookie.

Obviously this had a trickle down effect on a lot of things in our code. After running with his changes, if I bring up mailnews and then Close the app through the menu item, messenger is properly released. However, if I choose Exit instead, we leak. It appears that Close and Exit have slightly different implementations. Close gets a root webshell, gets a web window and then closes the web window. Exit gets the appshell and shuts it down. I wonder if shutting down the appshell is supposed to have a trickle down effect where all the windows are then closed. If true, then the close code is never getting called. Or should our implementation of Exit call Close first and then tell the appshell to shut down? \n",

The fault trigger was traced to session table timeout being exceeded and any further packets on what would be classed as a unknown session having their tcp header parameters nulled on return . The nett effect seemed to be that netscape on MAc ignored the return packet and waits for a packet that will not return (it clears after the browser session timeout, or a page in a different domain is accessed) . The intel and IE for MAc implementations seem to either utlise the return or force a retry which then gets handled correctly .

On the Mac build, I tried multiple profiles configuration where I noticed IMAP message not being copied to sent folder. POP and News messages were copied to the first server sent folder. There after, I switched to a single IMAP profile. Sent messages where not copied to the Sent Folder. I did check to make sure that a Sent folder was previous created in Nova before running Seamonkey. Exiting and restarting seamonkey to refresh the folder list did not help. The behavior is the same on other platforms using a single IMAP profile configuration. Steps to Reproduce: Configure you to have only one server configured for IMAP Start Apprunner Open Messenger using the Task menu or the through the Component Bar Select your imap server icon Double click on server It should expand your folder list Be sure you have a Sent folder Start a new message I was using a HTML compose Address the message to yourself, add a subject title, and add a short message Send message Click on the Sent folder Notice the message does not get copied to Sent folder The message you sent does get received to the recipient. Actual Results: The Sent folder is empty. If you exit and relaunch apprunner then view the sent folder, the folder is still empty Expected Results: A copy of the message should be copied to sent folder.

IMAP will work if you wait a long time (a few minutes) before performing an undo commmand. fails but you can force it to work if you switch between the Trash folder and Inbox. fails in all cases. To be certain of our results, we waited a few minutes after performing a operation before trying the undo command. My results were consistent with Ninoschkas. Steps to Reproduce: It easier if you are working with one account at a time that contains few folders and a Inbox folder with less than messages. Mac performance is extremely bad. Run Apprunner Open Messenger through the Task menu or Component bar Double click on the server icon to expand the folder list Select the Inbox Wait the messages to display in the thread window Select a message in the thread window Wait for the message to load in the message pane Perform one of these operations Delete Copy Move Wait a few \"minutes\" then select the Edit menu and choose Undo The operation fails to revert the last change. Actual Results: No operation occurs -If you performed a delete operation, then and undo command, the deleted message was not returned to the Inbox. The Trash folder still contains the deleted message. -If you performed a copy operation, then an undo command, the copied message is has not been removed from the destination folder. -If you performed a move operation, then an undo command, the moved message has not been returned to the Inbox. It is still present in the destination folder. Expected Results: The Undo command should revert the changes done by the last delete, copy, or move command. Additional Information: Due to performance problems, selecting a message or opening a folder is painfully slow.

      " Overview description: currently working on a scriptable XPCOM component. The interface is defined in XPIDL and I am running tests from Javascript. I ran into this problem with XPConnect: I have a method of a class A that returns the interface of an object of class B, call the interface IB. This works fine, the object crosses the XPConnect boundary and can be used on the Javascript side. Class A has another method that takes as an inout parameter an IB interface. In the implementation of I receive a pointer to a null pointer when the object produced by is sent as a parameter from the Javascript side. Changing the parameter to \"in\" gives the expected result. On the component side I get back the same pointer that was sent to the Javascript side. I could not find any example of using an inout interface parameter in the Mozilla code, so I suspect that nobody has noticed this problem before. Steps to reproduce: Create a simple XPCOM component with an interface defined in XPIDL that has two classes, A and B. Class A should have two methods, one that returns the interface of an object of class B and one that takes an interface of class B as an inout parameter. Print the values of the pointers returned by the first method and received by the second to the output window. Create a simple Javascript test program that creates an object of class A and calls the first method of A to get a B object. Call the second method of A giving the B object as a parameter. Run the test program and compare the pointer sent from the component side with the one received. Actual results: a pointer to an object sent, a pointer to a null pointer received Expected results: a pointer to an object sent, a pointer to the same pointer value received Build Date Platform Bug Found: Windows NT Additional Builds and Platforms Tested On: none Peter Dahl CITEC \n",
